# 🚀 Next.js Boilerplate App 🚀

Welcome to the **Next.js Boilerplate**—your one-stop shop for a solid starting point! This project combines the power of **Next.js (v14.2.16)**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Firebase Authentication** into one snazzy, secure package. With a protected dashboard route baked right in, you’ll be up and running faster than you can say “Hello, World!”

## 🎉 Features

- **Next.js v14.2.16**: Built on the latest version, because who doesn’t love staying current?
- **TypeScript**: Enjoy the safety and scalability of typed JavaScript, with no loose ends.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Lookin' good without the hassle! Style your app fast with Tailwind’s utility-first CSS.
- **Firebase Authentication**: We’ve got you covered on login—Firebase Auth makes it a breeze to add secure user authentication.
- **Protected Dashboard Route**: Lock down that dashboard like Fort Knox! Only authenticated users get to see this exclusive section.

## 🛠 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo** to your local environment.
2. **Install dependencies** with `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. **Set up Firebase**:
   - Head over to your Firebase Console, create a project, and grab your API keys.
   - Update the `.env.local` file with your Firebase config variables.
4. **Start the dev server**: Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to launch your app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 💻 Folder Structure

Here's how this app is laid out:

- **`/pages`**: All your Next.js pages, including the protected dashboard route.
- **`/components`**: Reusable UI components.
- **`/styles`**: Tailwind setup and global styles.
- **`/lib`**: Firebase and other helper functions.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

This app uses Firebase for user auth, ensuring a secure experience for users logging in. The **Dashboard** route is protected—meaning only logged-in users will gain access. No sneaky business here! 🕵️‍♂️

## 🚧 Roadmap

Want to make it your own? Here are a few ideas to take it further:

- Add more protected routes or custom roles (like admin access).
- Expand the dashboard with user data.
- Integrate more Firebase features (Firestore, anyone?).
